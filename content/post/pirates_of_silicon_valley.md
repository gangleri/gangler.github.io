Pirates of Silicon Valley is an old film now, but I’ve got to see recently. It 
tells the early story of Apple and Microsoft as they create the PC industry. 
The first thing to point out is that this film does not have the same level of 
production as The Social Network had and as a result at times may feel like a 
TV movie. However, if you’re a geek, you’ll find this entertaining given the 
portrayals of the leading characters. I particularly enjoyed John Di Maggio’s 
performance of Steve Ballmer.
