Since getting my Kindle, I've amassed more and more eBooks and one of the best 
tools I've found to manage all these books in Calibre. This is a free and 
open-source tool that helps you manage your library of eBooks and best of 
all it's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.

Calibre is rather like iTunes for your eBook; it allows you to define metadata 
for your books such as tags that allow you later to search for books. Alongside 
helping you to manage your collection calibre also allows you to convert books to 
different formats such as PDF to MOBI. Although the Kindle does support PDF, I tend 
to prefer converting the PDF to MOBI before dropping it onto my Kindle. All of which 
is very easily achieved using Calibre.

If you have any eBooks, I highly recommend that you check out Calibre. More information 
and the latest version of the [website](http://calibre-ebook.com)
