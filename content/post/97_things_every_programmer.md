Following on from [97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know][1] and the less 
heard of [97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know][2] this book full of [97 things 
programmers should know][3]. This book contains insight from many of today's best developers 
cutting code day after day.

Like the other books in this series, this book is extremely well written and presented 
in a very digestible format as each of the 97 points has a maximum of two pages. This 
lead to a book that is very easy to pick up and read cover to cover while community 
to work or even reading one or two points while waiting for a build to complete.

Alongside being an easy read book, it is also an excellent reference book and 
thanks to the well laid out table of contents which can be flicked through very 
quickly this is a book that can be used easily to help resolve the occasional 
cubical dispute.

Some of the topics will seem blatantly obvious while others were thought-
provoking and will maybe bring things more to your attention that you were 
subconsciously doing. The book isn't as intense as other classic titles such as 
The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete and the Art of Computer Programming; I 
still feel that this is a book that every programmer should have a go at reading. 
It isn't that expensive, and it's a very easy read so it won't take up too much 
of you time and you'll probably pick up a few things to think about will 
knocking out code.
