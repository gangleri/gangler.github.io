Buy this book!! I can't emphasise that enough; this book is clear advice on how 
to go about starting up a project and growing it from your pet project to a 
product that you can be passionate about and make work for you as a business.

Rework is not a very wordy book, and as a result, it's a book you can read very 
quickly, with each point the authors wish to raise is presented in only a few 
pages of large, clean fonts that are easy on the easy on your eyes. But don't 
for one minute think that the larger font and the cut-down content leads to a 
book that contains less advice. The complete opposite is the case the authors 
have produced a book with no cr@p!! As they say themselves in the introduction 
that the reader will thank them for the stuff they left out, I do thank them 
for this; the book is perfect.

As [Seth Godin][1] said in his review stop reading and buy [ReWork][2].
