Software development to me is a career that offers an excellent opportunity to 
be passionate about what you do. On the flip side, it's also easy to slip into 
a mundane routine buried beneath layers of bureaucracy. In which your passion 
fades and instead of the outstanding career you dreamed of you become an average 
programmer drifting from day to day ticking boxes going through the motions in 
the belief that titles and promotion are the keys to a safe job and happiness. 
Often many who climb the ladder find they were only truly happy while writing code.

If this sounds familiar, this is a book you must read! In the music industry i
recording artists continually reinvent themselves to stay relevant in modern 
times, this is what has separated the one hit wonders from musical legends 
that last for decades continuously amassing new fans and producing new material. 
The same rings true with software development. The book has an example of a developer 
pinning their entire career on becoming a J2EE architect the book points out do you 
want to pigeonhole yourself into a particular technology from one specific company?

Another thing developers my fret about is losing their jobs to cheaper overseas 
competition, the book offers excellent advice on this prospect by reminding us 
that the rapidly changing nature of IT was why many of us got into programming 
in the first place due to the constant challenge of learning something new. The 
book suggests embracing the chance to hone your skills and constantly critique 
where you're at so that you can be ready for the next change. A company would 
not sell old stock make sure you are not caught trying to sell yourself based 
outdated or unsellable skills.

The author Chad has a very clear writing style and his analogies between his 
career as a programmer and his earlier days as a Jazz musician are informative 
and an enlightened way to look at our careers as software developers. I can't 
recommend the book highly enough its full of excellent advice and is a very 
easily read book that won't take too much of your time but will give you so 
much.

The book will help you get into the mindset of continually adding value to 
yourself in such a way that the outstanding career you dreamed of can become a 
reality. As they say, "A rolling stone gathers no moss" ensure your skills 
aren't gathering moss.
