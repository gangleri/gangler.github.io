      <description>Given the hype you might be forgiven for mistaking HTML5 as the 2nd coming. But all joking aside this is a significant step for the web but what does it really offer web developers? Well this is a question that I feel is answered in HTML5 Up and Running.
First thing to point out is that this book at just under 200 pages, is not an in-depth coverage of all the new features coming with HTML5.</description>

      <description>Pirates of Silicon Valley is an old film now, but I’ve got to see recently. It tells the early story of Apple and Microsoft as they create the PC industry. The first thing to point out is that this film does not have the same level of production as The Social Network had and as a result at times may feel like a TV movie. However, if you’re a geek, you’ll find this entertaining given the portrayals of the leading characters.</description>

      <title>Java The Code Parts</title>

      <description>I’m a fan of the effective series of books (Effective Java, Effective C#, etc.) and was, therefore, looking forward to this book hoping to pick up a few gems I’d yet to discover. To be blunt, I was disappointed. The book is well written and concise, however having done significant Java development I found this book more of a nostalgic reminder of the advances Java had given us when it first appeared in the late nineteen nineties.</description>
