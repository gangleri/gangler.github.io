      <description>Given the hype you might be forgiven for mistaking HTML5 as the 2nd coming. But all joking aside this is a significant step for the web but what does it really offer web developers? Well this is a question that I feel is answered in HTML5 Up and Running.
First thing to point out is that this book at just under 200 pages, is not an in-depth coverage of all the new features coming with HTML5.</description>
