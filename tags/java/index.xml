      <description>I’m a fan of the effective series of books (Effective Java, Effective C#, etc.) and was, therefore, looking forward to this book hoping to pick up a few gems I’d yet to discover. To be blunt, I was disappointed. The book is well written and concise, however having done significant Java development I found this book more of a nostalgic reminder of the advances Java had given us when it first appeared in the late nineteen nineties.</description>
